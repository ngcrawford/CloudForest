Quick Start:
=================

1. Open terminal and prepare to cut-n-paste. 


2. Install `Python`_. Python should already be installed on OS X or Linux. CloudForest requires version 2.7 so enter ``python --version`` at the commandline and make sure you're uptodate. If you're not I recommend installing `Enthought Python`_ 2.7 which includes almost all the dependancies necessary to get CloudForest running.


3. Install `Git`_. Git is a distributed version control systerm. It's open source, easy to use, and integrates with github for easy collaboration and distribution.
  * I recommend first installing `HomeBrew`_ and then running ``brew install git`` at the command line to install git.


4. Install `Pip`_. Pip is a package installer for python that makes adding and managing packages and modules a breeze.


5. Install CloudForest by running ``pip install -U cloudforest`` at the commandline. Alternately you can install the most cutting edge development version by running ``pip install git+git://github.com/ngcrawford/CloudForest.git`` at the commandline.


That should do it for installation.


Configure Software:
-------------------

CloudForest itsself doesn't require any configuration, but one of it's dependancies does. `MrJob`_ has a pretty simple config file you'll need to setup if you want to run analyses on EMR. A full explaination is available `here`_.

You'll need to make a mrjob.conf file. Mine looks something like this::
    
  runners:
    emr:
      aws_access_key_id: YOURIDYOURIDYOURIDYOURIDYOURID
      aws_region: us-east-1
      aws_secret_access_key: YOURSECRETKEYYOURSECRETKEYYOURSECRETKEY
      ec2_key_pair: mr-keypair
      ec2_key_pair_file: /Users/YourUserName/.ssh/mr-keypair.pem
      ec2_instance_type: m1.small
      num_ec2_instances: 1
      setup_cmds: &setup_cmds
      ssh_tunnel_is_open: true
      ssh_tunnel_to_job_tracker: true
